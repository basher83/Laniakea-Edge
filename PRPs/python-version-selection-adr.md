name: "Python Version Selection ADR Creation PRP"
description: |

## Purpose
Create a comprehensive Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for Python version selection (3.11 vs 3.12) for the Laniakea-Edge project, following project conventions and evaluating based on project-specific requirements.

## Core Principles
1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, evaluation criteria, and project constraints
2. **Evidence-Based**: Support decision with benchmarks, compatibility data, and ecosystem analysis
3. **Information Dense**: Use specific performance metrics and compatibility matrices
4. **Project Alignment**: Follow existing ADR patterns and naming conventions
5. **Global rules**: Follow all rules in CLAUDE.md, especially ADR constraints (100 lines max)

---

## Goal
Create a Python Version Selection ADR (YYYYMMDD-python-version-selection.md) that definitively chooses between Python 3.11 and 3.12 for the Laniakea-Edge project, with clear justification based on project requirements.

## Why
- **Blocking Decision**: Python version is first in critical path, blocks all other technology decisions
- **Foundation Impact**: Affects library compatibility, performance characteristics, deployment options
- **Long-term Commitment**: Version choice impacts maintenance burden for 2+ years

## What
Architecture Decision Record documenting Python version choice with:
- Performance comparison data specific to async operations
- Library compatibility matrix for project dependencies
- Risk assessment for both options
- Clear recommendation with implementation steps

### Success Criteria
- [ ] ADR follows template structure exactly
- [ ] Decision based on quantifiable metrics
- [ ] All evaluation criteria from decisions-matrix.md addressed
- [ ] File named with today's date in YYYYMMDD format
- [ ] Under 100 lines total length

### Known Constraints & Requirements
```python
# CRITICAL: Project constraints from requirements.md
# - Must support async operations (NFR1.3: 100+ concurrent requests)
# - Must integrate with GitHub API (TC1: GitHub API v3/v4)
# - Must respect rate limits (TC2: 5000 req/hour)
# - Initial Python constraint: 3.9+ (TC3)

# CRITICAL: Planned dependencies from tech-stack.md
# - FastAPI (async framework - requires 3.7+)
# - LangChain (AI framework - requires 3.9+, dropped 3.8 Oct 2024)
# - Redis (cache - async client requires 3.7+)
# - Type hints (PEP 484 - better in 3.10+)
```

### ADR Content Template
```markdown
# Python Version Selection

- Status: proposed
- Date: 2025-09-08
- Tags: infrastructure, foundation, python

## Context and Problem Statement

The Laniakea-Edge project requires selecting a Python version that balances performance, 
ecosystem compatibility, and long-term maintainability. This decision blocks all subsequent 
technology choices and must support async operations at scale (100+ concurrent requests).

## Decision Drivers

- **Performance**: Must handle NFR1.3 (100+ concurrent analysis requests)
- **Library Compatibility**: FastAPI, LangChain, Redis clients must be fully supported
- **Long-term Support**: 2+ year maintenance window expected
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Production stability for API service

## Considered Options

- Python 3.11 - Mature async support, universal compatibility
- Python 3.12 - Enhanced performance, memory optimizations

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Python 3.12", because:
- 75% faster asyncio operations directly benefit our async-first architecture
- Memory optimization (50% reduction) crucial for concurrent request handling
- All required dependencies (FastAPI, LangChain, Redis) fully support 3.12
- Future-proofs project for 2+ year maintenance window

### Positive Consequences
- Significant async performance improvements for API operations
- Reduced memory footprint for containerized deployment
- Access to latest type hint improvements

### Negative Consequences
- Slightly less field testing than 3.11
- Potential 10% performance regression on AMD hardware (monitoring required)

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Python 3.11
- Good, mature ecosystem with 2+ years of production use
- Good, universal library compatibility guaranteed
- Bad, missing significant async performance improvements
- Bad, will require earlier migration to newer version

### Python 3.12
- Good, 75% faster asyncio critical for our use case
- Good, 50% memory reduction improves container efficiency
- Good, isinstance() performance helps Pydantic validation
- Bad, newer release with less production exposure
- Bad, minor performance regression on specific hardware
```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Format Validation
```bash
# Check ADR follows conventions
ls docs/decisions/$(date +%Y%m%d)-python-version-selection.md
# Expected: File exists with correct naming

# Verify line count
wc -l docs/decisions/$(date +%Y%m%d)-python-version-selection.md
# Expected: Less than 100 lines

# Check required sections present
grep -E "^## (Context|Decision Drivers|Considered Options|Decision Outcome)" \
  docs/decisions/$(date +%Y%m%d)-python-version-selection.md
# Expected: All sections found
```

### Level 2: Content Validation
```yaml
Checklist:
  - Status field: "proposed" or "accepted"
  - Date field: Current date in YYYY-MM-DD
  - Tags field: Includes "infrastructure"
  - Decision clearly stated: Python 3.11 or 3.12
  - Justification references: Project requirements
