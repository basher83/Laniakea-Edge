name: "API Framework Selection ADR - FastAPI vs Flask vs Django REST"
description: |

## Purpose
Comprehensive PRP for creating the API Framework Selection ADR with all necessary context, research findings, and implementation guidance to achieve one-pass implementation success.

## Core Principles
1. **Context is King**: Includes ALL research findings, documentation references, and evaluation criteria
2. **Validation Loops**: Provides clear validation steps for the ADR creation
3. **Information Dense**: Uses specific evaluation data from comprehensive research
4. **Progressive Success**: Start with framework comparison, validate, then document decision
5. **Global rules**: Follow all rules in CLAUDE.md and ADR guidelines

---

## Goal
Create a comprehensive Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for selecting the primary API framework for Laniakea-Edge, choosing between FastAPI, Flask, and Django REST Framework.

## Why
- **Critical Foundation Decision**: API framework choice affects entire architecture and development velocity
- **Blocking Other Decisions**: Service architecture, testing strategy, and deployment depend on this choice
- **Performance Requirements**: Must handle >1000 req/sec for repository analysis endpoints
- **AI Integration Needs**: Must support Model Context Protocol and AI agent consumption patterns
- **Developer Experience**: Framework choice impacts team productivity and onboarding

## What
Create an ADR that:
- Evaluates FastAPI, Flask, and Django REST against project requirements
- Provides clear scoring based on defined criteria
- Documents the decision with justification
- Includes implementation implications and migration paths

### Success Criteria
- [ ] ADR follows the template at docs/decisions/template.md exactly
- [ ] Evaluation covers all criteria from decisions-matrix.md
- [ ] Decision is data-driven with clear scoring
- [ ] File follows naming convention: YYYYMMDD-api-framework-selection.md
- [ ] ADR is concise (under 100 lines as per guidelines)

- Native WebSocket support for real-time features
- Best performance for I/O-bound operations

**Flask Strengths:**
- Maximum flexibility and control
- Huge ecosystem (58% Python web market share)
- Easiest learning curve for Python developers
- Flask-RESTX provides good OpenAPI support
- Battle-tested in production for 15+ years
- Excellent for microservices

**Django REST Strengths:**

- Excellent for rapid prototyping

### Project-Specific Requirements Analysis

From requirements.md:
- **NFR1.2**: API response time <100ms (p95) - All frameworks can achieve
- **NFR1.3**: Handle 100+ concurrent requests - FastAPI best, others adequate
- **FR4.1**: RESTful API endpoints - All support
- **FR4.2**: Model Context Protocol - All can implement with proper setup
- **FR4.3**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation - FastAPI native, others need extensions
- **FR4.4**: Async operations for long-running analyses - FastAPI optimal

### Known Gotchas
```python
# CRITICAL: FastAPI requires understanding async/await patterns
# Example: Blocking operations in async functions kill performance

# CRITICAL: Flask async is not truly async (still WSGI-based)
# Flask 2.0 async runs in sub-threads, not event loop

# CRITICAL: Django REST has highest memory overhead
# Not ideal for microservices with resource constraints
```

## Implementation Blueprint

### ADR Structure Requirements
The ADR must follow this exact structure from template.md:
1. Title (short problem and solution)
2. Status (set to "proposed")
3. Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
4. Context and Problem Statement (2-3 sentences)
5. Decision Drivers (key factors)
6. Considered Options (FastAPI, Flask, Django REST)
7. Decision Outcome (chosen option with justification)
8. Positive/Negative Consequences
9. Pros and Cons of each option

### Evaluation Scoring Formula
```python
# Based on decisions-matrix.md criteria weights
def calculate_score(framework):
    scores = {
        'async_performance': weight * 0.25,
        'openapi_support': weight * 0.20,
        'developer_experience': weight * 0.15,
        'mcp_compatibility': weight * 0.15,
        'ecosystem_maturity': weight * 0.10,
        'testing_support': weight * 0.10,
        'production_usage': weight * 0.05
    }
    return sum(scores.values())
```

```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Template Compliance
```bash
# Check line count
wc -l docs/decisions/20250908-api-framework-selection.md
# Expected: Less than 100 lines

# Verify all required sections present
grep -E "^## (Context|Decision Drivers|Considered Options|Decision Outcome|Pros and Cons)" docs/decisions/20250908-api-framework-selection.md
# Expected: All sections found
```

### Level 2: Content Validation
Verify:
- [ ] Status is "proposed" not "accepted"
- [ ] Date format is YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] All three frameworks are evaluated
- [ ] Decision drivers match requirements.md
- [ ] Justification references specific requirements

### Level 3: Cross-Reference Check
```bash
# Ensure consistency with decision matrix
grep "API Framework" docs/planning/decisions-matrix.md
# Status should show "In Progress"

# Check requirements alignment
grep -E "(NFR1\.[1-4]|FR4\.[1-4])" docs/planning/requirements.md
# All referenced requirements should exist
```

## Final Validation Checklist
- [ ] ADR follows template.md structure exactly
- [ ] File name follows YYYYMMDD-decision-name.md convention
- [ ] Under 100 lines (absolute maximum per guidelines)
- [ ] Decision is clear and justified with data
- [ ] Consequences are documented (positive and negative)
- [ ] All evaluation criteria from decisions-matrix.md addressed
- [ ] Requirements from requirements.md considered
- [ ] No excessive detail (keep concise)
- [ ] Status is "proposed" for review
- [ ] Links section references related ADRs if applicable

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Don't exceed 100 lines - be concise
- ❌ Don't skip the Negative Consequences section
- ❌ Don't make decision without clear justification
- ❌ Don't ignore requirements.md constraints
- ❌ Don't use "accepted" status - use "proposed"
- ❌ Don't include implementation details - ADR is for decision only

## Confidence Score
**9/10** - Comprehensive research completed, clear evaluation criteria, strong justification for FastAPI based on project requirements. One point deducted as team async experience level needs verification.

## Additional Context for Implementation

### Why FastAPI is Recommended
Based on comprehensive research and Laniakea-Edge's specific requirements:

1. **Performance Match**: Native async perfectly suits I/O-bound GitHub API operations
2. **AI Integration**: Companies like Microsoft, Uber use FastAPI for ML/AI workloads
3. **Documentation**: Automatic OpenAPI generation essential for MCP integration
4. **Type Safety**: Pydantic validation prevents bugs in complex scoring algorithms
5. **Modern Stack**: Aligns with Python 3.11+ and modern async patterns

### Migration Path if Needed
If decision changes later:
- FastAPI → Flask: Relatively easy, similar decorator patterns
- FastAPI → Django REST: More complex, requires ORM adoption
- Start with FastAPI for performance-critical services
- Can use Flask for admin/internal tools if needed

### Key Implementation Notes
- Use Python 3.11+ for best async performance
- Deploy with Uvicorn for production
- Implement proper async patterns from day one
- Leverage Pydantic for all data validation
- Use built-in dependency injection for clean architecture
