**API Gateway**
A server that acts as a single entry point for all client requests, handling routing, authentication, and rate limiting.

**Async Operation**
A non-blocking operation that allows other processes to continue while waiting for completion.

## C

**Cache Service**
A component that stores frequently accessed data in memory for faster retrieval and reduced API calls.

**Circuit Breaker**
A design pattern that prevents cascading failures by temporarily blocking requests to a failing service.

**CI/CD**
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment - automated processes for building, testing, and deploying code.

**Community Health**
A quality metric measuring the engagement and activity of a project's contributor community.

## D

**Discovery Service**
The component responsible for searching and filtering GitHub repositories based on specified criteria.

**Documentation Quality**
A metric evaluating the completeness and clarity of a repository's documentation.

## G

The REST and GraphQL APIs provided by GitHub for programmatic access to repository data.

**gRPC**
A high-performance, open-source RPC framework that uses Protocol Buffers for service communication.

## I

**IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**
The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files.

**Idempotency**
The property where an operation produces the same result regardless of how many times it's executed.

## K

**Kubernetes**
An open-source container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management.

## L

**LangChain**
A framework for developing applications powered by language models, enabling AI agent creation.

**LlamaIndex**
A data framework for LLM applications, specializing in ingesting, structuring, and accessing private data.

## M

**Maintenance Activity**
A quality metric measuring how actively a repository is maintained through commits, issues, and releases.

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
A standardized protocol for AI agents to discover and interact with external tools and services.

**Microservices**
An architectural style structuring an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services.

**Molecule**
A testing framework for Ansible roles and playbooks that supports multiple test scenarios.

## O

**OpenAPI**
A specification for describing REST APIs, enabling automatic documentation and client generation.

**Orchestrator Service**
The central coordinator that manages workflow execution and service communication.

## P

**Plugin Architecture**
A system design allowing functionality extension through modular, pluggable components.

**POC (Proof of Concept)**
A demonstration to verify that certain concepts or theories have practical potential.

**PyGithub**
A Python library providing access to the GitHub API v3.

## Q

**Quality Score**
A composite metric (0-10) evaluating a repository across multiple quality dimensions.

## R

**Rate Limiting**
Controlling the rate of requests to prevent API abuse and ensure fair usage.

**Redis**
An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.

**Repository Analysis**
The process of evaluating a code repository's quality, structure, and maintainability.

**REST (Representational State Transfer)**
An architectural style for designing networked applications using HTTP methods.

## S

**Service Mesh**
Infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication in microservices architectures.

**SLO (Service Level Objective)**
A target value or range for a service level that is measured by an SLI.

**SLI (Service Level Indicator)**
A quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service provided.

## T

**Terraform**
An Infrastructure as Code tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely.

**Testing Quality**
A metric evaluating the presence and comprehensiveness of tests in a repository.

**TTL (Time To Live)**
The duration for which cached data remains valid before requiring refresh.

## W

**Webhook**
An HTTP callback that occurs when something happens; a simple event-notification mechanism.

**Workflow Engine**
A system that manages and executes defined sequences of tasks or processes.
