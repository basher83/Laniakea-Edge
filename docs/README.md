# Laniakea-Edge Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the **Laniakea-Edge** project, an AI-powered quality engine for Infrastructure-as-Code repositories.

## 📚 Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into five main sections following a logical progression from research through implementation:

```
docs/
├── research/      # Completed research and analysis
├── planning/      # Active planning and tracking
├── architecture/  # Technical design documentation
├── decisions/     # Architecture Decision Records
└── reference/     # Quick reference guides
```

- **[api-design.md](./architecture/api-design.md)**: API specifications and contracts
- **[quality-framework.md](./architecture/quality-framework.md)**: Quality assessment methodology

*These define the technical blueprint for implementation.*

### [decisions/](./decisions/) - Architecture Decision Records
**Status**: 📋 Pending

Formal documentation of architectural decisions:
- **template/**: ADR template for new decisions
- **proposed/**: Decisions under evaluation
- **accepted/**: Approved architectural decisions
- **superseded/**: Replaced or outdated decisions

*ADRs will be created as decisions are made during Phase 0.*

### [reference/](./reference/) - Quick Reference
**Status**: ✅ Complete

Quick reference guides and summaries:
- **[glossary.md](./reference/glossary.md)**: Terms and acronyms
- **[tech-stack.md](./reference/tech-stack.md)**: Technology choices and status
- **[checklist.md](./reference/checklist.md)**: Pre-implementation checklist

*Handy references for team members and contributors.*

## 🎯 Current Project Status

### Phase 0: Planning & Architecture (Current)

| Area | Status | Next Action |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Research | ✅ Complete | Reference for decisions |
| Planning | 🔄 Active | Complete Phase 1 decisions |
| Architecture | ✅ Designed | Validate with POC |
| Decisions | 📋 Pending | Create first ADRs |
| Reference | ✅ Complete | Use during implementation |

### Critical Path (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Week 1**: Python version decision, POC setup
2. **Week 2**: API framework, AI framework, service architecture decisions
3. **Week 3-4**: POC implementation and validation

## 📖 How to Use This Documentation
