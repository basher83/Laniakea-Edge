- Performance and scaling considerations

## Key Research Findings

### Problem Validation
‚úÖ **Confirmed Need**: No integrated solution exists for AI-powered IaC quality analysis
‚úÖ **Market Gap**: Current tools focus on single metrics, not comprehensive quality assessment
‚úÖ **User Pain**: Manual repository evaluation is time-consuming and inconsistent

### Architecture Decisions
‚úÖ **Microservices**: Best approach for scalability and technology expansion
‚úÖ **Plugin System**: Enables clean addition of new IaC technologies
‚úÖ **AI Integration**: Model Context Protocol provides standardized agent interface

### Technology Direction
‚úÖ **Python**: Optimal for AI/ML integration and GitHub API interaction
‚úÖ **API-First**: Headless service design for AI agent consumption
‚úÖ **Container-Based**: Ensures consistency across environments

## Research Methodology

1. **Literature Review**: Examined existing tools and platforms
2. **Market Analysis**: Evaluated competitive landscape and gaps
3. **Technical Evaluation**: Compared architectural patterns and technologies
4. **Proof of Concept**: Validated key technical assumptions
5. **Stakeholder Input**: Gathered requirements from potential users

## Transition to Planning

The research phase has established:
- Clear problem definition and validation
- Technical feasibility confirmation
- Architectural direction consensus
- Technology stack candidates

These findings now inform the active planning phase in [`../2-planning/`](../2-planning/).
