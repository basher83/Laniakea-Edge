   - Versioning strategy

3. **Pluggable Architecture**
   - Technology-agnostic core
   - Plugin-based analyzers
   - Extensible framework

4. **Async Operations**
   - Non-blocking I/O
   - Message-driven communication
   - Event sourcing capability

5. **Cloud-Native**
   - Container-first deployment
   - Horizontal scalability
   - Stateless services
