## 🔄 Planning Process

### Weekly Planning Cycle

**Monday**: 
- Review decision matrix
- Update risk register
- Assign decision owners

**Wednesday**:
- Decision progress check
- Risk mitigation review
- POC status update

**Friday**:
- Update roadmap progress
- Document decisions made
- Plan next week priorities

### Decision Making Process

1. **Identify** - Add to decisions-matrix.md
2. **Research** - Evaluate against criteria
3. **Document** - Create ADR in 4-decisions/proposed/
4. **Review** - Team review and feedback
5. **Approve** - Move ADR to 4-decisions/accepted/
6. **Update** - Update decision matrix status

## 🚦 Go/No-Go Criteria

### Phase 0 → Phase 1 Gate

Must have:
- [ ] All Phase 1 decisions documented in ADRs
- [ ] POC validates technical feasibility
- [ ] Development environment reproducible
- [ ] No Critical risks unmitigated
- [ ] Team aligned on architecture

### Quality Gates

Each planning document must:
- Be reviewed by at least 2 team members
- Have clear ownership assigned
- Include success metrics
- Define acceptance criteria
- Maintain version history
