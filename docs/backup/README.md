# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder contains all Architecture Decision Records for the Laniakea-Edge project. ADRs document important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.

## üìÅ Current Structure

## üìù ADR Process

### Creating a New ADR

**Use meaningful filenames (e.g., 001-use-postgresql.md) and maintain a numbered or dated sequence for easy navigation.**

1. **Copy the template**:

   ```bash
   cp template.md 0003-your-decision-title.md
   ```
   
   Use the next sequential number (0003, 0004, etc.)

2. **Fill out all sections**:

   - Status (Proposed)
   - Context (problem background)
   - Decision (what we're doing)
   - Consequences (positive, negative, risks)
   - Alternatives (options considered)
   - Implementation (action items)

3. **Submit for review**:
   - Create pull request
   - Tag relevant stakeholders
   - Schedule review meeting if needed

    B -->|Replace| C[Superseded]
    A -->|Reject| D[Rejected]
```

### Review Criteria

ADRs are evaluated based on:

- **Completeness**: All sections filled comprehensively
- **Clarity**: Decision and rationale are clear
- **Evidence**: Data/research supports the decision
- **Impact**: Consequences are well understood
- **Alternatives**: Other options were considered

## üìê ADR Template Structure

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-YYYY-MM-DD: [Title]

## Status

Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated

## Context

What is the issue we're seeing that is motivating this decision?

## Decision

What we're doing and how we're doing it.

## Consequences

### Positive

- What becomes easier or better?

### Negative

- What becomes harder or more complex?

### Risks

- What could go wrong?

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: [Name]

- Description
- Why we didn't choose it

## Implementation

Key steps to implement this decision

## References

- Links to relevant documentation
```

## üîç Finding ADRs

### By Category

- **Infrastructure**: Deployment, scaling, monitoring
- **Architecture**: Services, communication, patterns
- **Technology**: Languages, frameworks, libraries
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, encryption
- **Development**: Testing, CI/CD, tooling

### By Impact

- **High Impact**: Affects entire system architecture
- **Medium Impact**: Affects specific services/components
- **Low Impact**: Local optimizations or tools

### By Date

ADRs are named with date prefix (YYYY-MM-DD) for chronological ordering.

## üìä Decision Metrics

### Decision Velocity

- Target: 2-3 decisions per week during Phase 0
- Current: 0 decisions per week
- Status: üî¥ Behind schedule

### Decision Quality

Measured by:

- Time to implementation
- Reversal rate
- Team satisfaction
- Technical debt created

## üîó Related Documentation

### Context and Research

- [`../1-research/`](../1-research/) - Background research
- [`../2-planning/decisions-matrix.md`](../2-planning/decisions-matrix.md) - Decision tracking

### Implementation Guidance

- [`../5-reference/tech-stack.md`](../5-reference/tech-stack.md) - Technology options

## üìÖ Review Schedule

| Day       | Activity            |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Monday    | New ADRs proposed   |
| Wednesday | Team review session |
| Friday    | Approval/feedback   |

## üö¶ ADR Health Indicators

### Good Signs ‚úÖ

- Clear problem statement
- Multiple alternatives evaluated
- Quantifiable success criteria
- Implementation plan included
- Team consensus achieved

### Warning Signs ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Vague problem definition
- Single solution considered
- No success metrics
- Missing implementation steps
- Lack of team buy-in

## üìù Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- Weekly: Update ADR index
- Monthly: Review superseded ADRs
- Quarterly: ADR process retrospective

### Quality Checks

- [ ] All decisions have ADRs
- [ ] ADRs follow template
- [ ] Status is current
- [ ] Implementation tracked
