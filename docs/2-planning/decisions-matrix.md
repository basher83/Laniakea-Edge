# Project Decisions Matrix

This document identifies the key decisions that need to be made to move the Laniakea-Edge project forward from research to implementation. Each decision requires an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) following the template at [`docs/ADR/ADR-TEMPLATE.md`](../ADR/ADR-TEMPLATE.md).

## Decision Evaluation Framework

### Standard Evaluation Criteria

All decisions should be evaluated against these core criteria:

1. **Technical Fit** - Does it meet functional requirements?
2. **Performance** - Can it handle expected load and scale?
3. **Maintainability** - Is it well-documented and actively maintained?
4. **Community** - Is there strong community support and ecosystem?
5. **Cost** - What are licensing, operational, and development costs?
6. **Risk** - What are potential failure modes and mitigation strategies?
7. **Team Expertise** - Do we have or can we acquire necessary skills?

### Decision Boundaries

To avoid overlap and conflicts, decisions are organized by architectural layer:
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Deployment, scaling, monitoring
- **Service Layer**: API framework, service boundaries, communication
- **Application Layer**: Business logic, quality metrics, analysis
- **Integration Layer**: External APIs, AI frameworks, data flow
- **Development Layer**: Testing, tooling, CI/CD

- When changing an existing architectural decision
- When rejecting an architectural approach after evaluation
- When documenting design assumptions that may change

### ADR Quality Standards

- **Defined Decision**: State what was chosen and why
- **Consequences**: Document positive, negative, and risk impacts
- **Alternatives**: List options considered and rejection rationale
- **Implementation**: Provide actionable implementation steps

### ADR Review Process

1. Draft ADR with all required sections
2. Technical review by team members
3. Stakeholder alignment on decision impacts
4. Final approval and implementation planning
