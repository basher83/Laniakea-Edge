2. `geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker` - Excellent documentation
3. `robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap` - Strong testing

### Known Poor Examples
1. Abandoned repositories (>2 years no updates)
2. No documentation repositories
3. No testing repositories

### Edge Cases
1. Very large repositories (>1000 files)
2. Minimal repositories (<10 files)
3. Non-English documentation

## Risk Mitigation

| POC Risk | Mitigation | Fallback |
|----------|------------|----------|
| GitHub API too restrictive | Test with authenticated requests | Implement aggressive caching |
| Microservices overhead too high | Test modular monolith | Consolidate services |
| Scoring algorithm inaccurate | Iterate with user feedback | Simplify metrics |
| AI integration complex | Test multiple frameworks | Direct API integration |
| Performance inadequate | Profile and optimize | Reduce analysis scope |

## Decision Points

After POC completion, decide:

1. **Architecture Pattern**
   - Microservices (if latency acceptable)
   - Modular monolith (if simplicity preferred)

2. **Technology Stack**
   - FastAPI vs Flask (based on performance)
   - LangChain vs custom (based on complexity)

3. **Scoring Approach**
   - Rule-based (if accurate enough)
   - ML-based (if rules insufficient)

4. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Serverless (if cost-effective)
   - Container-based (if control needed)

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- API response time: <100ms (p95)
- Analysis time: <30s per repository
- API calls per analysis: <50
- Memory usage: <512MB per service
- CPU usage: <1 core per service

### Quality Metrics
- Scoring accuracy: >80% agreement
- False positive rate: <10%
- Result consistency: 100%

### Integration Metrics

## Timeline

| Week | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|

## POC Review Criteria

The POC will be considered successful if:

1. **Technical Feasibility**: All spikes completed successfully
2. **Performance Validated**: Meets minimum requirements
3. **Quality Demonstrated**: Scoring provides value
4. **Integration Proven**: AI agent connection works
5. **Risks Mitigated**: No blocking issues discovered

## Next Steps After POC

Based on POC results:

1. **If Successful**:
   - Finalize architectural decisions
   - Begin Phase 1 implementation
   - Expand team if needed

2. **If Partially Successful**:
   - Address identified issues
   - Adjust architecture as needed
   - Extend POC for problem areas

3. **If Unsuccessful**:
   - Pivot to alternative approach
   - Re-evaluate requirements
   - Consider scope reduction
