- **Examples**: AWS CloudFormation, Azure ARM, GCP Deployment Manager
- **Coverage**: Single cloud provider focus
- **Gaps**: No multi-cloud assessment, vendor lock-in limitations


### Key Market Gaps Identified

1. **No Comprehensive Quality Framework**: Current tools focus on security or syntax, not holistic quality assessment
2. **Technology Fragmentation**: Each IaC tool has separate ecosystem with no unified evaluation
3. **Limited AI Integration**: Existing tools lack native support for AI agent consumption patterns[^20]
4. **Discovery vs. Quality Separation**: Repository discovery and quality assessment exist as separate, disconnected processes

## 3. Technical Feasibility Assessment
