# Technical Research Summary

This document consolidates the technical research conducted during the initial exploration phase of the Laniakea-Edge project.

## AI Tool/Plugin Architecture Research

### Model Context Protocol Approach

The research identified that the optimal architecture follows an AI tool/plugin model using the Model Context Protocol. This positions the service as a headless microservice that integrates with AI assistants rather than a standalone application.

**Key Findings:**
- No direct UI needed - the service's "user" is another AI agent
- Enables modular integration where parent AI handles human conversation
- Aligns with the evolving landscape of AI agent ecosystems
- Future-proof design supporting multiple AI platforms

### Microservices vs Monolithic Analysis

**Microservices Benefits Identified:**
- Component isolation for focused development
- Clean integration layers between services
- Independent scaling of analyzer components
- Technology-agnostic core with specialized plugins
- Easier testing and maintenance of individual services

**Potential Challenges:**
- Inter-service communication overhead
- Increased operational complexity
- Distributed system debugging challenges
- Need for service discovery and orchestration

## Extensibility Framework Research

### Pluggable Analyzer Architecture

The research confirmed that a plugin-based architecture best supports multi-technology expansion:

**Core Orchestration Engine (Generic Layer):**
- Technology-agnostic workflow orchestration
- External API interfacing (GitHub, etc.)
- Plugin loading and execution management
- Report generation and synthesis

**Analyzer Plugins (Specialized Layer):**
- Technology-specific evaluation logic
- Domain expertise encapsulation
- Self-contained modules for easy extension
- Separate plugins for Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes, etc.

### Service Component Design

Research identified three essential service components:

1. **GitHub Discovery Service**
   - Repository search and filtering
   - Advanced query construction
   - Rate limit management
   - Result ranking and prioritization

2. **Technology Analyzer Services**
   - Quality metric evaluation
   - Testing framework detection
   - Documentation assessment
   - Maintenance activity analysis

3. **Orchestrator/API Gateway**
   - Request routing and coordination
   - Result aggregation and synthesis
   - AI agent interface management
   - Response formatting for MCP

## Technology Stack Research

### Programming Language Evaluation

**Python Selected Due To:**
- Mature AI/ML ecosystem (LangChain, LlamaIndex)
- Excellent GitHub API libraries (PyGithub)
- Strong async support with modern frameworks
- Extensive testing tools and frameworks
- Rich data processing capabilities

### API Framework Candidates

Research identified top candidates:
1. **FastAPI** - Async, automatic OpenAPI, high performance
2. **Flask** - Mature, flexible, extensive ecosystem
3. **Django REST** - Batteries included, robust, proven
4. **Falcon** - Minimalist, high performance, RESTful

### AI Integration Options

**LangChain:**
- Extensive tool/agent support
- Strong community and documentation
- Built-in GitHub integration capabilities
- Token optimization features

**LlamaIndex:**
- Superior document processing
- Advanced retrieval capabilities
- Better for structured data analysis

**Custom Integration:**
- Maximum control and optimization
- Reduced dependencies
- Potential for better performance
- Higher development effort

## Performance Considerations

### Identified Requirements
- <30s repository analysis time
- <100ms API response time (p95)
- Support for 100+ concurrent analyses
- GitHub API rate limit handling (5000 req/hour)
- Efficient caching strategy needed

### Scaling Research
- Horizontal scaling for analyzer services
- Caching layer for GitHub data
- Queue-based job processing for long analyses
- Circuit breakers for external API failures

## Security Research

### Key Considerations
- API key management for GitHub access
- Authentication for AI agent clients
- Rate limiting per client
- Data encryption for cached results
- Audit logging for compliance

## Deployment Research

### Container Strategy
- Docker for local development parity
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Container orchestration evaluation needed
- Service mesh considerations for microservices

### Cloud Platform Options
- AWS (ECS, Lambda, API Gateway)
- GCP (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions)
- Azure (Container Instances, Functions)
- Self-hosted Kubernetes

## Conclusions from Research

1. **Microservices architecture** provides the best balance of flexibility and maintainability
2. **Plugin-based analyzers** enable clean technology expansion
3. **Python with FastAPI** appears optimal for the use case
4. **Model Context Protocol** alignment ensures AI agent compatibility
5. **Caching strategy** is critical for GitHub API rate limits
6. **Container-based deployment** provides consistency across environments

## Next Steps Identified
