## Context and Problem Statement

We need to select an API framework for Laniakea-Edge's microservices architecture. Which Python API framework best supports our requirements for async operations, automatic documentation, and AI agent integration?

## Decision Drivers

- **Performance**: Must handle >1000 req/sec for repository analysis (NFR1.3)
- **OpenAPI Generation**: Automatic API documentation required (FR4.3)
- **Model Context Protocol**: Support for AI agent integration patterns
- **Async Operations**: Native support for I/O-bound GitHub API calls
- **Developer Experience**: Type safety and modern Python patterns
- **Production Readiness**: Proven in ML/AI workloads at scale

## Considered Options

- **FastAPI** - Modern async framework with automatic OpenAPI generation
- **Flask** - Lightweight, flexible microframework with extensive ecosystem
- **Django REST** - Full-featured framework with comprehensive tooling

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **FastAPI**, because it provides native async support critical for I/O-bound repository analysis, automatic OpenAPI generation essential for MCP integration, and proven success in ML/AI workloads at Microsoft, Netflix, and Uber.

### Positive Consequences

- Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation at `/docs` for AI agents
- Native async/await for efficient GitHub API operations
- Type safety with Pydantic reduces bugs in complex scoring logic
- Built-in validation and serialization
- WebSocket support for future real-time features

### Negative Consequences

- Team requires async/await pattern training
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Flask/Django
- Newer framework with less battle-testing in enterprise

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### FastAPI

- Good, because native ASGI with excellent async performance
- Good, because automatic OpenAPI generation without extensions
- Good, because Pydantic validation catches errors at runtime
- Good, because proven in production ML/AI workloads
- Bad, because learning curve for async patterns
- Bad, because smaller third-party package ecosystem

### Flask

- Good, because maximum flexibility and control
- Good, because huge ecosystem (58% Python web market share)
- Good, because simple learning curve for Python developers
- Good, because battle-tested for 15+ years
- Bad, because requires Flask-RESTX for OpenAPI support
- Bad, because async support limited (WSGI-bound)

### Django REST

- Good, because comprehensive feature set
- Good, because built-in admin interface
- Good, because enterprise-grade security features
- Good, because strong ORM and migrations
- Bad, because high overhead for microservices
- Bad, because steeper learning curve for team
