# Python Version Selection

- Status: proposed
- Date: 2025-09-08
- Tags: infrastructure, foundation, python

## Context and Problem Statement

The Laniakea-Edge project requires selecting a Python version that balances performance, ecosystem compatibility, and long-term maintainability. This decision blocks all subsequent technology choices and must support async operations at scale (100+ concurrent requests per NFR1.3).

## Decision Drivers

- **Performance**: Must handle 100+ concurrent analysis requests with <100ms p95 latency
- **Library Compatibility**: FastAPI, LangChain, Redis clients must be fully supported
- **Long-term Support**: 2+ year maintenance window expected
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Production stability for API service
- **Team Expertise**: Ability to leverage modern Python features

## Considered Options

- Python 3.11 - Mature async support, universal compatibility
- Python 3.12 - Enhanced performance, memory optimizations

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Python 3.12", because:
- 75% faster asyncio operations directly benefit our async-first architecture
- 50% memory reduction crucial for concurrent request handling and containerization
- All required dependencies (FastAPI, LangChain, Redis) fully support 3.12
- Future-proofs project for 2+ year maintenance window
- Released October 2023, now mature with 1+ year of production use

### Positive Consequences

- Significant async performance improvements for API operations
- Reduced memory footprint for containerized deployment
- Access to latest type hint improvements
- Better Pydantic validation performance via isinstance() optimizations

### Negative Consequences  

- Slightly less field testing than 3.11
- Potential 10% performance regression on AMD hardware (monitoring required)

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Python 3.11

- Good, mature ecosystem with 2+ years of production use
- Good, universal library compatibility guaranteed
- Good, stable performance baseline across all hardware
- Bad, missing significant async performance improvements
- Bad, will require earlier migration to newer version
- Bad, larger memory footprint for concurrent operations

### Python 3.12

- Good, 75% faster asyncio critical for our use case
- Good, 50% memory reduction improves container efficiency  
- Good, isinstance() performance helps Pydantic validation (2-20x faster)
- Good, all project dependencies verified compatible
- Bad, newer release with less production exposure
- Bad, minor performance regression on specific hardware
