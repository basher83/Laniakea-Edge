## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Planning & Architecture (Phase 0)
- ‚úÖ Research completed
- üîÑ Architecture decisions in progress  
- üìã POC planned for validation
- ‚è≥ No implementation code yet

See [Planning Documents](docs/planning/) for current progress and [Decision Matrix](docs/planning/decisions-matrix.md) for pending architectural decisions.

## Vision

Building a comprehensive quality assessment platform for the entire Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) landscape, enabling developers and organizations to discover and evaluate high-quality code repositories with confidence.

## Solution Overview

Laniakea-Edge will be a specialized AI research assistant designed to solve the critical "signal vs. noise" problem in IaC ecosystems. Designed as an API-first microservice using the Model Context Protocol, it will serve as an intelligent tool that AI agents, CI/CD pipelines, and development teams can utilize for comprehensive repository analysis.

### Core Capabilities

- **Automated Repository Discovery**: Intelligent GitHub search and filtering across IaC ecosystems
- **Multi-Faceted Quality Scoring**: Comprehensive evaluation based on testing frameworks, maintenance activity, documentation standards, and community health
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Advanced reasoning and synthesis for actionable insights
- **Extensible Architecture**: Pluggable analyzer system supporting multiple IaC technologies

## Current Focus: Ansible Ecosystem

The initial release delivers the most comprehensive quality analysis available for the Ansible ecosystem, evaluating repositories based on:

- **Testing Frameworks**: Molecule and ansible-lint integration
- **Maintenance Activity**: Commit frequency and active contributor engagement
- **Documentation Quality**: README completeness and usage examples
- **Community Health**: Issue resolution times and collaborative development patterns

## Architecture: AI Tool/Plugin Model

### Microservices Design

Laniakea-Edge follows a modern microservices architecture with specialized components:

#### Core Services

- **GitHub Discovery Service**: Expert repository search and filtering
- **Ansible Analyzer Service**: Domain-specific quality assessment
- **Orchestrator/API Gateway**: Request coordination and result synthesis

#### Model Context Protocol

The service implements a comprehensive API contract enabling seamless integration with:

- Custom GPTs and AI assistants
- LangChain-powered applications
- CI/CD pipelines and automation workflows
- Development tools and IDE integrations

## Technology Stack (Under Evaluation)

### Pending Decisions

The following technologies are being evaluated and will be finalized through Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):

| Technology | Options | Status | Decision Target |
|------------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **Language** | Python 3.11, 3.12 | üìã Pending ADR | Week 1 |
| **API Framework** | FastAPI, Flask, Django REST | üîÑ Evaluating | Week 2 |
| **AI Integration** | LangChain, LlamaIndex, Custom | üìã Pending ADR | Week 2 |
| **GitHub Client** | PyGithub, GitHub GraphQL | üìã Not Started | Week 3 |

### Confirmed Technologies

- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Planned Usage

*Note: This project is currently in the planning phase. The following represents the intended design and API.*

### Future Installation

```bash
# Planned installation method (not yet available)
pip install laniakea-edge
```

### Planned API Design

#### Repository Analysis Endpoint
```http
POST /v1/analyze
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "repository_url": "https://github.com/example/ansible-role",
  "technology": "ansible"
}
```

#### Expected Response Format
```json
{
  "repository": "example/ansible-role",
  "overall_score": 8.5,
  "metrics": {
    "testing": 9.0,
    "documentation": 8.0,
    "maintenance": 9.5,
    "community": 7.0
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Add Molecule tests for better validation",
    "Include more usage examples in README"
  ]
}
```

### Planned Model Context Protocol Integration

The service will implement MCP for AI agent integration:

```python
# Planned integration example
{
  "tool": "analyze_repository",
  "parameters": {
    "repository_url": "https://github.com/ansible/ansible",
    "technology": "ansible"
  }
}
```

See [API Design Documentation](docs/architecture/api-design.md) for complete specifications.
